Database
========

All database interaction is done using Php Doctrine (www.phpdoctrine.org).

Naming Conventions
------------------

Tables are named in plural.

The table names are mapped onto classes in the 'ktapi2/Lib/Base' directory. The base classes are used to implement
ActiveRecord-like functionality.

All tables that require an auto increment field include a field named 'id'.


Installation
------------

During development, 'ktapi2/Docs/ktdms.sql' will be used as a dump file for the database schema.

For production, 'ktapi2/Bin/buildDb.php' will be used.

KnowledgeTree Specific Notes
----------------------------

We implement a few database views mapping onto 'groupings'.

'groupings' and 'users' share a common id based on the 'members' table.

The members table is quite useful as it allows us to manage the parent child relation between a number of different entities
and allows us to reduce the complexity of the way these relations are stored.
