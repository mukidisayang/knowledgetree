Webservice
==========

Using the reflective nature of actions, we can create the following dynamically:
1) wsdl based on the current plugins
2) option to snapshot wsdl definition based on state of actions....
3) expose SOAP, XML-RPC functions
4) expose JSON functions - input via HTTP POST params, output as json structure. Arrays are are type suffixed with 'Collection'.
Eg. Structure[Array]OfDocuments => DocumentCollection
5) generate client stubs in different languages based on template code
