Namespaces
==========

1) Actions

Actions have namespaces associated with them.

If they operate on a specific kind of item, then their primary item should follow immediately after
the action.


e.g. action.add.document should become action.folder.add.document
action.delete.document should become action.document.delete
action.delete.folder should become actiond.folder.delete
